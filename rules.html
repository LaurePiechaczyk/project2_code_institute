<h2>German verbs with prepositions</h2>
<p>As in English, some German verbs are followed by prepositions to give a certain meaning. These are called "verbs with prepositions".
    For example, "to wait for" would be "warten auf" in German.
</p>
<p>How can a person learning German learn which preposition goes with which verb?</p>
<p>Well, as in many challenges, there are many ways. Some people would be able to remember it easily 
    just by reading or listening to German (the lucky ones). Some verbs with prepositions are 
    similar in English and German, but unfortunately not all of them are.
</p>
<h2>Learning by matching verbs using the same preposition.</h2>
<p>Some verbs use the same preposition. For example, the verbs
     "warten" and "achten" use the preposition "auf".
</p>
<p>So why not learn verbs by matching verbs that use the same preposition?</p>
<p>That's what this site is all about.</p>

<h2>The Memo Game</h2>
<p>It is inspired by memory card games where the player has to turn over cards to find pairs of identical pictures.
    Instead of finding pairs of pictures, the player of the German Memo Game has to find pairs of verbs with the same preposition.
</p>

<h2>Quiz game</h2>
<p>The quiz has the particularity that in case of a wrong answer, the player will receive a feedback with the right answer 
    (the right preposition) and also a list of verbs that have the same preposition.
</p>

<h2>Limits of the games</h2>
<h3>Accusative/Dative</h3>
<p>In German, verbs with prepositions can be followed by the accusative or the dative. In this game, the accusative or
     dative is not taken into account.
</p>
<h3>Verbs with more than one preposition</h3>
<p>Some German verbs can be followed by different prepositions giving different meanings. For example: sich freuen can be followed by the prepositions auf or über. sich freuen auf = to look forward to, while sich freuen über = to be pleased.
    These verbs were not used in the game.
</p>
<h3>Verb list</h3>
<p>The list of verbs has been done manually and could be increased. I did my best to avoid mistakes, but I'm human ... If there are mistakes, I am sorry.
</p>

<h2> Enjoy</h2>
<p>I hope you will use these games to improve your German while having fun.</p>
