German verbs with Prepositions is a website built as part of a project for the [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) (training to become a web developer) to develop and show my skills in javascript.

# About the project 
In order to practice, develop and demonstrate my HTML, CSS and particurlarly js skills, I created the responsive website German verbs with Prepositions. German verbs with Prepositions is a website with a game and a quizz to learn the German verbs with Prepositions
I have chosen this theme because I am myself learning german.

## Background to understand the usefullness of the game
As in English, some German verbs are followed by prepositions to give a certain meaning. These are called "verbs with prepositions". For example, "to wait for" would be "warten auf" in German.

It leads to the question: 
How can a person learning German learn which preposition goes with which verb?

## Idea behind the website to help learning german
To learn a language, repetition is the key and, in my opinion, boredom is the biggest obstacle.

It is thus important to find ways to avoid boredom and games can be very useful.


Another idea behing this website is to learn by matching verbs using the same preposition.
Some verbs use the same preposition. For example, the verbs "warten" and "achten" use the preposition "auf".

That's what this site is all about: Fun + matching verbs with same preposition

# Target audience
People learning German and particurlarly people wanted to improve their knowledge about German verbs with preposition.
