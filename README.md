<h1 align="center"> Project 2 for Code Institute formation | German verbs with Prepositions - HTML & CSS & js</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://laurepiechaczyk.github.io/project2_code_institute/)

German verbs with Prepositions is a website built as part of a project for the [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) (training to become a web developer) to develop and show my skills in javascript. 

To do this, I created a game to learn German verbs with prepositions.

# About the project 
In order to practice, develop and demonstrate my HTML, CSS and particurlarly js skills, I created the responsive website German verbs with Prepositions. German verbs with Prepositions is a website with a game and a quizz to learn the German verbs with Prepositions.
I have chosen this topic because I am learning German myself.

## Background to understand the purpose of the game
As in English, some German verbs are followed by prepositions to give a certain meaning. These are called "verbs with prepositions". For example, "to wait for" would be "warten auf" in German.

It leads to the question: 
How can a person learning German learn which preposition goes with which verb?

## Idea behind the website to help learn German
To learn a language, repetition is the key and, in my opinion, boredom is the biggest obstacle.

It is thus important to find ways to avoid boredom and games can be very useful.


Another idea to develop this website is to learn by matching verbs using the same preposition.
Another idea to develop this website is to learn by matching verbs using the same preposition.

That's what this site is all about: Fun + matching verbs with same preposition

# Features 
## Composition of the website
The site is composed of 3 pages. The home page is a game called Memo game which contains links to another page which is a quiz and a last page which contains the rules and explanations about the site.

- ### Memo Game
The German Verbs with Prepositions Memo Game is inspired by memory card games where the player must turn over cards to find pairs of identical pictures. Instead of finding pairs of pictures, the player of the German memo game must find pairs of verbs with the same preposition.
